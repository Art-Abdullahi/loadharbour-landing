# Components Directory

This folder contains reusable React components. 

## Guidelines
- Each component should be placed in its own subfolder (e.g. `Button/Button.jsx`, `Button/index.js`)
- Include a `README.md` for complex components
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Write components as functional components
- Use PropTypes or TypeScript for type checking
- Ensure components are styled with Tailwind CSS
- Export components via `index.js` for easy imports

## Example Structure
```
components/
  Button/
    Button.jsx
    index.js
    README.md
  Card/
    Card.jsx
    index.js
    README.md
```
